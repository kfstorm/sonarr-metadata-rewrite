# Sonarr Metadata Rewrite - Features

## Project Overview
Create a compatibility layer that monitors Sonarr-generated .nfo files and overwrites them with TMDB translations in desired languages, addressing [Sonarr Issue #269](https://github.com/Sonarr/Sonarr/issues/269).

## Core Features

### üåç Automatic Translation
- [x] **Monitor .nfo Files**: Automatically detect when Sonarr creates or updates metadata files
- [x] **Series Metadata Translation**: Translate TV show titles, descriptions, and other metadata
- [x] **Episode Metadata Translation**: Translate individual episode titles and descriptions
- [x] **Real-time Processing**: Translate files immediately after Sonarr writes them to minimize English metadata visibility

### üó£Ô∏è Multi-language Support
- [x] **Multiple Preferred Languages**: Configure multiple target languages with priority order
- [x] **Priority-based Translation**: Try languages in order of preference until translation is found
- [x] **No Translation Fallback**: If none of the preferred languages are available, leave original metadata unchanged

### üíæ Backup & Recovery
- [x] **Original File Preservation**: Keep backups of original Sonarr-generated files
- [x] **Rollback Capability**: Ability to restore original English metadata if needed
- [x] **Safe File Operations**: Prevent data loss through atomic file operations

## Advanced Features

### ‚ö° Performance & Efficiency
- [x] **Smart Caching**: Cache TMDB translations to minimize API calls and improve speed
- [ ] **Rate Limit Compliance**: Respect TMDB API rate limits
- [ ] **Skip Already Modified Files**: Track files we've already translated and skip re-processing when scanning or monitoring detects them again, preventing unnecessary API calls and processing cycles
- [x] **Batch Processing**: Efficiently handle large media libraries with hundreds/thousands of files
- [x] **Minimal Resource Usage**: Lightweight service that doesn't impact system performance

### üîß Configuration Management
- [x] **Minimal Configuration**: Work with just TMDB API key, monitoring directory, and preferred languages
- [x] **Flexible Setup**: Easy configuration of monitored directories and translation preferences
- [x] **Configuration Validation**: Clear error messages for invalid settings

### üõ°Ô∏è Reliability & Error Handling
- [x] **Sonarr Integration Protection**: Handle Sonarr's metadata refresh cycles without conflicts
- [x] **API Failure Recovery**: Continue operating gracefully when TMDB API is unavailable
- [x] **File System Resilience**: Handle concurrent file access and file system events safely
- [x] **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed logging for troubleshooting and monitoring

## User Experience Features

### üöÄ Ease of Use
- [ ] **Simple Installation**: Easy setup process with clear documentation
- [ ] **Automatic Discovery**: Automatically find and monitor Sonarr media directories
- [ ] **Status Reporting**: Clear indication of translation progress and system status
- [x] **Command Line Interface**: Simple commands for starting service and checking status

### üîç Monitoring & Visibility
- [ ] **Translation Statistics**: Track how many files have been translated
- [ ] **Error Reporting**: Clear reporting of any issues or failures
- [ ] **Progress Tracking**: Show translation progress for large media libraries
- [ ] **Health Checks**: System health monitoring and diagnostics

### üîó Compatibility
- [ ] **Sonarr Compatibility**: Work seamlessly with existing Sonarr installations
- [ ] **Media Center Support**: Maintain compatibility with Kodi, Plex, Jellyfin, and other media centers
- [ ] **Cross-platform Support**: Work on Linux, Windows, and macOS
- [ ] **Docker Support**: Containerized deployment option

## Success Criteria
